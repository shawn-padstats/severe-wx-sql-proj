Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County.
