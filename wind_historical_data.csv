Some drying aloft and cooling 500 mb temps allowed for some steeping of mid-level lapse rates. Plentiful low-level moisture was also still available with PWATs close to 1.6 inches.

Time estimated via radar. A nearby weather station recorded a 55 mph wind gust.,"As an upper-level trough moved over the Florida Peninsula, abundant low-level moisture and diurnal heating led to plenty of instability in the atmosphere on May 18th. Numerous showers and thunderstorms formed in the afternoon and evening across South Florida, with severe thunderstorms observed across Palm Beach County.",

A thunderstorm wind gust of 54 mph/47 knots was measured at a sensor in Florida Gardens, with radar estimates of winds near 60 mph in the general area.","As a surface frontal boundary pushed southward through the southeastern United States, winds began to veer southwest bringing moist, warm air into South Florida on June 7th. With this moist air, sea breeze formation enabled stronger storms to bring gusty winds across the southeastern portion of the region. These strong winds, with the passing showers and thunderstorms, reached 50-65 mph leading to minor damage in portions of metro SE Florida.",

The large wind field around Helene brought tropical storm force winds to a good portion of southern Florida, with the most consistent area of sustained tropical storm force winds over western Collier County on September 26th. Brief but strong tropical storm force wind gusts affected the remainder of southern Florida. Some of the strong wind gusts associated with Helene were not directly associated with rainbands, but due to the very strong pressure gradient and daytime heating which acted to mix down strong winds just above the surface. Most locations experienced some wind damage, primarily to trees. Sections of Collier County observed minor roof and structural damage from wind. ||Significant coastal flooding occurred along the Collier County coast from storm surge.|The first flooding episode, of up to moderate levels, occurred with the high tide on the morning and midday of September 26th when the initial storm surge from Helene reached the area. The subsequent low tide was muted by increasing surge from the major hurricane, with the highest and most impactful flooding occurring during the evening/night high tide cycle of September 26th and early morning of September 27th.|Tide levels reached 4.02 ft above Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) at Naples Bay near the city dock, and NWS storm surveys indicated an 3-4 feet above ground in beachfront locations in Naples, and 1-3 feet above ground in Marco Island, Goodland, Everglades City, and Chokoloskee. Storm surge flooding mainly affected streets and parking lots, but several structures near and along the coast had minor to moderate water intrusion. ||Two EF-0 tornadoes impacted Collier County with very minor damage.||The total effects of Helene in South Florida resulted in about $1.3 million in damage, almost entirely from storm surge flooding in coastal Collier County.",
